## Week 8 Task - Tester

### Problem Description

Consider a CSV file that stores a list of records (e.g., records of bank accounts). You are required to write a software program that reads two such CSV files, compares records stored in these CSV files row by row against a unique combination and records all mismatches as exceptions. Finally, the software program generates another csv file listing the exceptions.

### How to Run the Program

Download the project and open it in any JAVA environment. Try to run `Main.java` to see the example of comparing `sample_file_1.csv` and `sample_file_3.csv`, and output the comparing result in `test_file_comparing_1_and_3`.

You can also run it with specified `comparingFileA`, `comparingFileB` and `fileOutput` in terms of `Tester.test(comparingFileA, comparingFileB, fileOutput);`.
